/*
    Enhanced Semantic Views with Signal Strength for Snowflake Intelligence
    This section creates a comprehensive semantic view that includes both
    infrastructure metrics AND critical QoS/signal strength data.
    
    The semantic view enables natural language queries like:
    "Which areas have poor WiFi coverage and need additional access points?"
    "How does signal strength correlate with throughput performance?"
    "Show me interference patterns during peak business hours"
    
    Key components:
    - Infrastructure and QoS table definitions with business context
    - Signal strength (RSSI) analysis and coverage assessment
    - Throughput, latency, and packet loss correlation with signal quality
    - Interference detection and environmental factor analysis
    - Comprehensive WiFi performance and coverage analytics
