    - Data relationships and integrity are maintained
    - Transformations produce correct results
    - Governance controls are working
    - Semantic views are operational
    - Business scenarios are demonstrable

    Comprehensive Demo Validation Complete!
    
    This validation script has tested:
    ✓ All database objects exist and contain expected data volumes
    ✓ Data relationships and foreign key integrity are maintained  
    ✓ JSON transformations and analytical views work correctly
    ✓ Governance controls (masking, RBAC) are properly configured
    ✓ Semantic views are operational and ready for Snowflake Intelligence
    ✓ Business scenarios are detectable and support meaningful analytics
    ✓ Performance is acceptable for demo purposes
    ✓ End-to-end data pipeline flows correctly from raw JSON to insights
    
    All created objects are actively used and validated:
    - RAW_NETWORK_TELEMETRY: JSON staging with VARIANT processing
    - DIM_NETWORKS & DIM_ACCESS_POINTS: Dimension tables with business context
    - FACT_AP_STATUS: Primary fact table with performance metrics
    - VW_AP_PERFORMANCE: Analytical view combining JSON and dimensional data
    - NETWORK_ANALYTICS_SV: Semantic view for natural language queries
    - Masking policies and roles for governance demonstration
    - Agent test questions for intelligence validation
    
    The demo is ready for presentation and showcases:
    1. Snowflake's VARIANT data type and JSON processing capabilities
    2. Data transformation from semi-structured to analytical format
    3. Native governance with dynamic masking and RBAC
    4. Semantic views for business context and natural language understanding
    5. Snowflake Intelligence for conversational analytics
    
    Total demo objects: 13 (all actively used and validated)
